to showcase my new\
RTYI optimizations.\
I've edited the entire\
SM64 source code for this.\
The SM64 decomp was\
a huge help in this,\
as it allows me to\
effeciently edit\
all of Mario 64's code.\
I applied the newest\
N64 knowledge so that\
levels are rendered up\
to 5 times faster than\
in the original game!\
It features a new\
camera, polished\
physics and can\
run up to 60 FPS,\
even on real N64!"))
