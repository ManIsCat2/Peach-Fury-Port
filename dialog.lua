This game was created\n\
to showcase my new\n\
RTYI optimizations.\n\
I've edited the entire\n\
SM64 source code for this.\n\
The SM64 decomp was\n\
a huge help in this,\n\
as it allows me to\n\
effeciently edit\n\
all of Mario 64's code.\n\
I applied the newest\n\
N64 knowledge so that\n\
levels are rendered up\n\
to 5 times faster than\n\
in the original game!\n\
It features a new\n\
camera, polished\n\
physics and can\n\
run up to 60 FPS,\n\
even on real N64!"))
